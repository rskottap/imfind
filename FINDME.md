## ImFind üñºÔ∏è 

Remember what an image, pic or screenshot looks like but can't for the life of you remember where you put it? 

Or what you named it? 

Or there's just too many damn screenshots to go through all of them? 

<img src="include/imfind-comic.png" alt="Comic" width="60%"/> 

Been there. Too many times.

So here's a simple tool to help with that.

### How it works

Given a description of an image you want to find, this library: 


1. Embeds the given user description using an embedding model. 


2. Finds all images in the given directory and (if not already previously done (via caching)) generates a description of the each of the images and embeds them. Uses an image-to-text like model with a default prompt to generate a decription of the image, optionally adding a user custom prompt if provided. 


3. Finds the most similar images based on similarity between the user description and the generated image description embeddings (nothing fancy, just your simple dot products).
